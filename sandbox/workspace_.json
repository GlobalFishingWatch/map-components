          "description": "<p>This layer shows vessels at sea that satellites have detected by the light that they emit at night. This includes all vessels that emit a lot of light at night, including non-fishing vessels. However, the majority of lights detected at sea at night come from commercial fishing vessels. The satellite makes a single over-pass across the entire planet every night, detecting lights not obscured by clouds and designed to give at least one observation globally every day. Because the vessels are detected solely based on light emission, we can detect individual vessels and even entire fishing fleets that are not broadcasting AIS and so are not represented in the AIS-based fishing activity layer. Lights from fixed offshore infrastructure and other non-vessel sources are excluded.</p><p>To construct this layer, the GFW platform ingests boat detections processed from low light imaging data collected by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) <a href='https://jointmission.gsfc.nasa.gov/viirs.html' target='_blank'>Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)</a>. The boat detections are processed in near-real time by NOAA’s <a href='https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/index.html' target='_blank'>Earth Observation Group</a>, located in Boulder, Colorado. The product, known as <a href='https://ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/viirs/download_boat.html' target='_blank'>VIIRS Boat Detections</a>, picks up the presence of fishing vessels using lights to attract catch or to conduct operations at night. More than 85% of the detections are from vessels that lack AIS or Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) transponders. Due to the orbit design of polar orbiting satellites, places closer to polar will have more over-passes per day, while equatorial regions have only one daily.  Read more about this product, and download the data here: <a href='https://ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/viirs/download_boat.html' target='_blank'>https://ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/viirs/download_boat.html</a></p><br/><h4>Southern Anomaly Zone:</h4><p>South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) is an area where the Earth's inner Van Allen radiation belt is at its lowest altitude, allowing more energetic particles from space to penetrate. When such particle hit the sensors on board of satellite, it creates a false signal which might cause the VBD algorithm to recognize it as a boat detection. A filtration algorithm has been implemented but more needs to be done to lower the possibility of mis-identification. </p><br/><p>The GFW layer includes all detections which NOAA has classified with QF=1 (boat) with a radiance value at the detector of at least 10 nano watts per square centimeter per steradian  nW/(cm^2 - sr)  (see the <a href='https://ncc.nesdis.noaa.gov/VIIRS/VIIRSFAQ.php' target='_blank'>VIIRS FAQ</a> for more)</p>",

          "description": "<h3>Encounters:</h3><br/><p>Vessel encounters were identified from AIS data as locations where two vessels were continuously within 500 meters for at least 2 hours, while at least 10 km from a coastal <a href='https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/globalfishingwatch.github.io/blob/rendezvous/anchorages.html' target='_blank'>anchorage</a>. These parameters balance the need to detect vessel pairs in close proximity for extended periods of time while recognizing that incomplete satellite coverage and inconsistent AIS transmission rates may limit our ability to identify long periods in which vessels are in immediate contact. We exclude encounters that occur in port or commonly used anchorages, because 1) transshipment at port is generally better regulated than at sea and 2) it would be challenging to determine if vessels were rendezvousing at a commonly used anchorage, or if they were just both using the same anchorage.</p><h3>Potential Transshipments</h3><br/><p>The <a href='https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/globalfishingwatch.github.io/blob/rendezvous/transshipment.html' target='_blank'>transshipments dataset</a> and the <a href='http://globalfishingwatch.org/map/' target='_blank'>Global Fishing Watch map</a> encounters layer use the subset of encounters where one of the vessels is identified a fish carrier and the other as a fishing vessel. We refer to these rendezvous as potential transshipments.</p><h3>Transshipment Vessels:</h3><br/><p>A database of refrigerated cargo vessels capable of receiving catch was compiled using three complementary methods. First, vessels classified as “refrigerated cargo” vessels, “fish carriers,” and “fish tender” vessels-- vessels we collectively refer to as “transshipment vessels”--were identified using lists from the International Telecommunications Union and major Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). Second, if we found a vessel participated in multiple encounters with fishing vessels, we conducted a web search and reviewed RFMO registries using information from the vessel's AIS to determine if the vessel was a transshipment vessel. Finally, we used a convolutional neural network, which predicts vessel class from vessel movement patterns (network described in Kroodsma et al. 2018), to identify possible transshipment vessels. Vessels that were identified as likely transshipment vessels by the neural network were manually validated through web searches and RFMO registries. Vessel identities were further corroborated via the IMO as nearly all vessels could be matched to an IMO registry number.</p><h3>Fishing Vessels:</h3><br/><p>Fishing vessels were identified by combining vessels that consistently self identify as fishing vessels with those identified as fishing vessels by the the convolutional neural network mentioned above. This list is available <a href='https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/treniformis/tree/master/treniformis/_assets/GFW/FISHING_MMSI/KNOWN_AND_LIKELY' target='_blank'>HERE</a>.</p>",
